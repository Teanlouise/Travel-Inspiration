Using Python, I developed a travel destination recommendation program demonstrating the use of control structures and functional decomposition. It was submitted as Assignment 1 for CSSE1001 at UQ. Software design choices and documentation were a key aspect of the grading criteria.

_destination.py, destination.csv and specifications are the property of University of Queensland_
